# Caliber Performance Management Suite

## Project Description and Objectives

### Description

Caliber is a performance management suite used to collect and analyze evaluations 
of Revature trainees with the goal of increasing transparency, fostering informed 
decision making, and creating actionable information. Caliber takes input for any quality checkpoint from the beginning to the end of the associate lifecycle (screening, training, QC, panel, etc). The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity using visual dashboards and tabular data. Users can generate individual and batch PDF reports to distribute to clients, trainees, and other stakeholders.

### Objectives

* Deliver timely reports to various stakeholders in an elegant and professional format
* Effectively communicate key performance indicators through meaningful data visualization
* Centralize trainee performance data to enable company-wide data aggregations
* Combine disparate spreadsheets into a single point of entry for trainee evaluations
* Provide a complete and accurate view of each trainee's technical capabilities
* Standardize evaluation processes through consistent data gathering and reporting
* Give actionable feedback to trainees to help increase their performance

## Current State

Trainee evaluations are recorded into Excel spreadsheets. Each trainer typically 
creates a new spreadsheet for each batch, and each week's grades are separated into tabs.
A level of standardization exists in the form of a Weekly Report spreadsheet, which 
requires direct oversight to enforce compliance with the standard format. Trainers upload 
their spreadsheets to Salesforce to report performance to managers and executives. In order 
to perform aggregations on week-by-week data or overall metrics, the trainer must either 
write custom multi-tab Excel functions or resort to manual calculations to create custom 
reports. Excel spreadsheets are disparate and isolate, and multi-batch reporting is 
nearly impossible. Performance reports given to clients do not convey Revature's desired level 
of maturity and professionalism.

## Scope

Caliber will provide trainers and quality auditors with consistent data entry 
and reporting media to standardize evaluation processes at Revature. Caliber will 
produce professional and distributable reports to provide stakeholders with relevant 
information--increasing transparency and improving decision making.

### Features 

* Trainers can input grades and feedback for each of their trainees
* The quality department can input their evaluations on the batch of trainees
* Trainers and quality personnel can comment on trainee and batch performance
* Panelists can input their evaluations on each trainee for their final interviews
* Users can generate reports and charts to visualize KPIs and print PDF reports
* The Caliber suite also provides a variety of reports on different levels of granularity:
    Week-by-week, Batch overall, Trainee weekly, Trainee overall
* Higher-level aggregations of data provide monthly, quarterly, and yearly reports to compare trends across longer periods of time.
